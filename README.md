# Health For All (HFA) - A Healthcare App for Remote Health Monitoring and Support

**Health For All (HFA)** is an innovative mobile application designed to improve access to healthcare for underserved communities, such as the elderly, disabled, and individuals in remote or low-income areas. The app allows users to monitor their health, securely store medical data, and easily connect with healthcare professionals, especially doctors, for consultation and diagnosis.

## Key Features

### Hardware Integration
The app integrates with a compact and portable health monitoring device that tracks multiple critical health metrics, including:
- **SPO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation)**
- **Heart Rate**
- **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**
- **Heart-Lung Sounds**
- **Temperature**

The device is designed to be user-friendly and easy to operate, with data wirelessly transmitted to the app. This enables users to monitor their health continuously and share the data with doctors for expert evaluation.

### App Features
- **User Profile Management**: Users can create and manage personalized health profiles.
- **Health Record Management**: The app stores health data from the monitoring device, organizing and displaying it in a user-friendly manner.

- **Medication and Measurement Reminders**: The app reminds users to take medication and perform health measurements.
- **Health Alerts and Notifications**: Critical health data triggers alerts and notifications, keeping users informed about their health status.
- **Chatbot Assistance**: A built-in chatbot provides guidance on health and app usage, offering basic advice and directing users to seek professional care when necessary.

## Impact and Necessity
HFA aims to address the healthcare access gap for individuals who cannot frequently visit doctors or hospitals. By providing remote monitoring and easy communication with doctors, the app ensures that users, especially those in rural areas, have access to healthcare when needed, improving health outcomes and ensuring timely interventions.
